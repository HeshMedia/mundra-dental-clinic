            "Orthodontics is a specialized branch of dentistry that focuses on diagnosing, preventing, and treating misaligned teeth and jaw irregularities. This field primarily deals with correcting issues like crooked teeth, gaps, overbites, underbites, and overcrowding, using appliances such as braces, clear aligners, and retainers. By aligning the teeth and jaws properly, orthodontic treatments not only enhance the aesthetics of a smile but also contribute to better oral function and long-term dental health.",
            "Misaligned teeth can lead to difficulties in chewing, speech problems, and an increased risk of tooth decay and gum disease due to improper cleaning. Orthodontic treatments gradually move teeth into their ideal positions, ensuring a balanced bite and reducing strain on jaw muscles. Whether for children, teenagers, or adults, orthodontic care is a highly effective way to achieve a healthier and more confident smile."
